# RedBlackTree
This repository was created just as challenge I gave myself to warm up on my skillset with Binary Trees.
I decided to pick the Red Black Tree as I had no prior experience with, and I've heard it is somewhat difficult 
to implement some of the methods due to the various cases to keep the time complexity at O(log(n)).

# Challenges
Overall, the project was a success. Most methods were fairly easy, as insert and delete were the few methods that were far different
from a standard binary search tree. Programming the delete method and debugging the various cases was the more time consuming part of the
project. 

# Usage
You can clone this if you'd like, but I would advise just using c++'s map or set, as under the hood they use a red black tree.
